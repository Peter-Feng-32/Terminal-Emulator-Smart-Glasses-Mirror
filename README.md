# Tooz-Glasses-Project


Goal: ASCII Star Wars
Learn how curses works and how to make a terminal emulator
Start writing a terminal emulator for the tooz glasses so curses can run on top of it
Can put terminal on glasses or on phone and send text to glasses.  Works good with bluetooth
Send graphics primitives to glasses instead of images, glasses will reconstruct image from primitives
